      Well, where do I start? I guess at the beginning!! I was born in Prescott, AZ in 1992, but from 1994-2012 I was raised in Apple Valley, Ca. I was a feisty little blonde girl that used to delight in wearing a bright orange ski jumpsuit to school - and even church! Loved playing scientist, hand-to-hand combat with imaginary enemies, and besides the presence of God, nothing still beats the feeling of riding on the back of my dad's motorcycle. I asked a lot of questions and wasn't afraid to let the world know how I sang and danced. Paintbrushes and tables were my microphone and stage. From making up dances and building forts, camping in the living room, to knowing everything there is to know about Super Mario Brothers 3 and Disney, I have LITTLE to say against my childhood. THANK YOU, MOTHER AND FATHER. Perhaps the BEST story is my mother finding me in the bathroom with full blown tears telling her how much of a sinner I am. I think I was 3? Perhaps you are asking why that's the best story I can tell you. That's where my foundation was laid. Utter conviction that I am completely separated from God because of sin. Let's fast forward!! Jr high- rebellious. High school- rebellious. I think we all can relate. Although I did decent in school and started working at 14 to be able to buy my very first truck, by the time I was 16- I grew up way too fast. I'll spare the details, but continue to follow my blog if you want to know more details of my life! I grieve growing up too fast and am currently working on growing back down (praise the LORD). Let's keep going! I was able to achieve my first-degree black belt in Tang Soo Do not too much longer after this and became a phlebotomist. I currently still work at Palmdale Regional Medical Center (7 years -- woop!!) I am also crossed-trained in pathology. Not going to expand on pathology details for the queasy people reading. =] I HAVE THE SWEETEST little boy named Paxton who is amazing - and a gift. And my joy. And my peace. And my squishy Mcsquisherson. My buddy who journeys with me on this life adventure. I got married in 2013 and divorced this year (2017). This divorce was another road to Jesus (yay!). This divorce was not my choice, and this divorce was the only biblical grounds for divorce. So where am I now? The greatest thrill and fulfillment I get is when the Holy Spirit moves within me to touch people who he chooses. I decided in 2014 that sitting in a pew afraid to raise my hands in praise was NOT where I was supposed to be (I AM NOT SAYING the conservative church is wrong). I personally choose to dance. And wave colorful, silky flags in the air always knowing my Father in heaven is enthralled and rejoicing over me in return. Don't ask me how this came to me - it just did. I just do it, love it, and enjoy it. Let's remember I used to wear a bright orange ski jumpsuit to school, I think me waving silky material in the air is fitting. So if my theme hasn't jumped out to you yet, I  LOVE JESUS. He IS life, He IS love, and HE lives inside of me AND Woah. It gets better and better every time I say it - I have a desire to touch the nation of Ireland and am currently taking 2 trips per year. I am also the co-founder of Guardian outreach. We feed the homeless of the Antelope Valley. Pray for me. SERIOUSLY. I need it. A very wise woman (who is DEAR to my heart) told me that when she sees me, she sees a woman with "big sails". I couldn't agree more. I have very big sails. And I pray earnestly they will always be steered in the correct direction. I feel it in my bones that God is going to move like has never happened in history before. I believe He is going to do it in a way that is nothing you ever expected. Stay in God's Word, the Bible, but open to His spirit so that you may perceive. My greatest dream I could ever attain is to be a part of this move. Please stay connected with me!
